# Lab 00 - Setting up the lab environment
In this lab we will configure our development environment ready for the labs in the *Programmning in C#* course. 

The purpose of this lab is to standardize the development environment at the same time making it as widely available as possible. To that end, these instructions could be performed at home or work to recreate the course environment to attempt the labs and demonstrations in the course.

**Expected duration:** 40 minutes (depending on internet download speeds)

## Lab objective
At the end of this lab you should have a development environment setup with [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.com) as well as a cloned copy of the [GitHub](https://github.com) repository for this course.
